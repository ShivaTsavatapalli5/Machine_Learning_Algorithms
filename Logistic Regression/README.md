# Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project presents a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on a dataset of medical records. The model is built using **Logistic Regression**, a commonly used classification technique in health-related predictive analytics.

## 📁 Files

- `heart_disease_prediction_Logistic_Regressison.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full workflow — data loading, analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `heart.csv`: The dataset containing medical attributes and heart disease labels.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes medical attributes such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type (`cp`)
- Resting blood pressure (`trestbps`)
- Serum cholesterol (`chol`)
- Fasting blood sugar (`fbs`)
- Resting ECG results (`restecg`)
- Maximum heart rate (`thalach`)
- Exercise-induced angina (`exang`)
- ST depression (`oldpeak`)
- Slope of ST segment (`slope`)
- Number of major vessels (`ca`)
- Thalassemia (`thal`)
- Target variable (`target`): 0 = No heart disease, 1 = Heart disease
